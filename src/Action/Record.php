     * Plays a prompt (audio file or text to speech) then optionally waits for a response from the caller and records it.
     *
     * If collected, responses may be in the form of DTMF or speech recognition using a simple grammar format defined below.
     * The record function is really an alias of the prompt function, but one which forces the record option to true
     * regardless of how it is (or is not) initially set. At the conclusion of the recording, the audio file may be
     * automatically sent to an external server via FTP or an HTTP POST/Multipart Form. It may also be sent to your
     * Amazon S3 bucket. If desired, the audio file can also be transcribed and the text returned to you via an
     * email address or HTTP POST/Multipart Form. Although the record function will allow extremely long recordings,
     * transcription is limited to three hours. If you attempt to transcribe something longer than that,
     * you will not receive a transcription.
